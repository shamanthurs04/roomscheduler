### Overview:
Meeting Room Scheduler is a web application that users can use to schedule meetings in available rooms. Users are shown all available rooms on their preferred date and time, and based on their selection, they can choose to book the room by paying the price. They also have the option to purchase add-ons to their meeting rooms like food, and beverages. Admin Users are also allowed to foresee the rooms, add/delete rooms, and view feedback. At the end of the project, users (Student/Staff/Admin) should be able to successfully login, logout, and book/delete/view meetings successfully.
